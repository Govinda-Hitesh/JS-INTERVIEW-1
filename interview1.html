1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
== used for comp. two variable but it ignores the datatype of variable.
=== is udes to comp. two variable but this operator also checks datatype and comp. two values
exp:-
0==false//true, because false is equivalent of 0
0===false// false,because both operands are of different type

2.What is the spread operator?
spread operator that consists of three dots (...). The spread operator allows you to spread out elements of an iterable object such as an array, map, or set. 
exp:-
const odd = [1,3,5];
const combined = [2,4,6, ...odd];
console.log(combined);

//[ 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5 ]

3.What are the differences between var, let and const?
var - it can be declared withour initialization
let - it can be declared without initialization
const - it cannot be declared without initization.

4.What is execution context
avaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates execution contexts.
Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.
exp:-
let x = 10;

function timesTen(a){
    return a * 10;
}

let y = timesTen(x);

console.log(y); // 100

5.What is meant by first class functions
the function can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be reteturned by another function.
exp:-
const Arithmetics = {
    add: (a, b) => {
        return `${a} + ${b} = ${a + b}`;
    }
}
document.write(Arithmetics.add(100, 100) + );//200


6.What are closures?
the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state
exp:-
function makeFunc() {
    var name = 'hitesh';
    function displayName() {
      alert(name);
    }
    return displayName;
  }
  
  var myFunc = makeFunc();
  myFunc();
